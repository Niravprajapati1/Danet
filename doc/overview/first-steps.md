In this set of articles, you'll learn the **core fundamentals** of Danet. To get familiar with the essential building blocks of Danet applications, we'll build a basic CRUD application with features that cover a lot of ground at an introductory level.

### Prerequisites

Please make sure that [Deno](https://deno.land/) (version >= Install
v1.24.3) is installed on your operating system.

### Setup

The easiest way to set up a Danet project is by using our [Danet CLI]().
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Savory/Danet-Starter.git nameofyourproject
$ cd nameofyourproject
```

The app is a simple in memory todo app.

#### Running the application

Once the installation process is complete, you can run the following command at your OS command prompt to start the application listening for inbound HTTP requests:

  ```bash
$ deno task launch-server
```
